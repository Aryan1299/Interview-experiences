                  Then they were asking work-related questions to others.

                <p>I had my SP Jain interview today…
                  GI 1: 2 panelists: both male, one from finance (20 years of experience in RBI) the other was from quants
                  department (don’t remember the exact name)
                  Panel details: I was from marketing, 2 finance, 2 IM</p>

                <p>Tell me about yourself interestingly without including what we already know (same question to all)
                  How can you apply electrical and electronics engineering in marketing…
                  If u are so good I marketing, sell any product from your domain to the girl sitting next to you. (Went
                  very much down the hill as the girl beside me was totally hell-bent on not getting persuaded by me and
                  kept saying “no” to every question of mine. Don’t know why)</p>
                <p>what kind of company would you like to work in? (I gave very cliche answers here and one of the
                  interviewers said I not being very exciting and not giving any new answers. I corrected myself and said
                  something better). Later the topic drifted towards how to make pizzas better as one guy had mentioned he
                  loves cooking.</p>
                <p>What is the problem if we ask all the customers how much customization they want? (Answered by saying
                  they would take up time and reduce productivity.. he seemed quite satisfied)</p>

                <p>After this, we waited for round-2. Our panel was the first panel of the day where all of us were
                  selected for round 2. No elimination.</p>

                <p>GI 2: Panelists: 1 male 1 female
                  Panel details: 2 marketing 2 finance 1 Operations</p>

                <p>The whole interview was about our psychometric tests… They had formed a character image about us and
                  pushed us to the extreme to admit us to do something that’s the opposite of what we wrote.</p>

                <p>Example: I had said I hate lies… He asked, “do u think marketing people never lie?”.
                  I said, ” they do but I will choose not to lie”. “But how can you sell without lying”
                  “Using emotional connections”…</p>

                <p>A couple of follow up questions…</p>

                <p>They tried to break everyone else too… Me and 2 others didn’t break…
                  The last two broke. One had said he avoids confrontations but later admitted to confrontation being a
                  better choice… Then the interviewer admitted the interview was a bit pushy… But that was just to know us
                  better.
                  They wished us the best of lucks and the interview ended. They gave us wearable pen drives.</p>

                <p>Personal advice… Don’t budge from what you said no matter how much they push you…</p>

                  Work responsibilities
                  Why IM and not MS or MTech
                  Second Round:</p>

                <p>Tell me something about you not in this form.
                  What is one thing you hate about your sibling/parents?
                  What is something about your previous generation that you hate?
